# Goal
This assignment is designed to help students better understand secure coding principles and build a sustainable Android app.  

We provide a code base of an open source application TodoList. It allows users to make todo lists in the app. You can create a list, remove it and change settings to remind you as needed. Basic functions have been implemented. You can test it on your own device or simulator. 

# Instruction
## Assignment Preparation
Before diving in to coding assignment, please make sure you have done preparations correctly.

* Install Android Studio and SDK.
* Clone project from https://github.com/avjinder/Minimal-Todo to your local working file.
* Run your project on your simulator or device. 

## Requirements 
You already have a working app at this point, we want you implement some functions following the secure coding principles above. You can find several empty functions with ***//ToDo...*** as a comment. Please complete those functions:

* Function1
* Function2
* Function3

You may noticed that we violated some secure coding principles in a couple of places in the code, which have potential security issues. Please find them under comment ***// Violation...*** and  fix those bugs in following functions:

* Function1
* Function2
* Function3

After completing this assignment, your code should be:

* Asking permission from users before turning on notification and access contact and turn unnecessary privileges off.
* Bug-free and pass our unit test.
* Adding possible notations and easy to read or extend for future use.
